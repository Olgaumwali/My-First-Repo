B rief introduction about myself
Hello! My name is Umwali Olga, and I’m currently a learner on the ALX Pathway. I joined the program to gain practical skills in technology, leadership, and entrepreneurship, with the goal of building solutions that make a real impact in my community. Through ALX, I’ve been exposed to hands-on projects, collaborative learning, and mentorship that are shaping me into a future-ready professional. I'm passionate about continuous growth and excited to contribute to innovative projects as I develop my career.
