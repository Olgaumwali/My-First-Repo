My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year

In the coming year, my personal goal is to continue growing in character, confidence, and discipline. I want to strengthen my relationship with God, build healthy habits, and develop a positive mindset that allows me to overcome obstacles with courage and faith. I also plan to take on new challenges that will help me become more independent and responsible in both my personal and professional life.

Academically, my goal is to fully engage with the ALX pathway, mastering the skills Iâ€™m learning and applying them to real-world projects. I aim to improve my time management, deepen my understanding of technology and leadership, and seek opportunities for mentorship and collaboration. Ultimately, I want to position myself for future internships or scholarships that will support my dream of making a meaningful impact in my community.
